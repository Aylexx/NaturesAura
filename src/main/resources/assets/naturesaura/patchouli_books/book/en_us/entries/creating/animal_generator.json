Creating $(aura) using the $(item)Disentangler of Mortals$() is especially so: Killing any passive animal close to it will cause the animal's soul to be freed and spread into the environment in the form of a rather big amount of $(aura). For this, baby animals' souls are less fulfilled, causing less $(aura) to be dispersed."

Additionally, supplying the $(item)Disentangler of Mortals$() with a death while it is already in the process of converting a soul will cause both the animal's soul not to be freed and its remains not to be dropped."
