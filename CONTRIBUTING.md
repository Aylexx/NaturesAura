I swear to God, if one more person reports that stupid Fast Leaf Decay bug, I will lose my goddamn mind.

Check [#82](https://github.com/Ellpeck/NaturesAura/issues/82), [#87](https://github.com/Ellpeck/NaturesAura/issues/87), [#98](https://github.com/Ellpeck/NaturesAura/issues/98) or [#102](https://github.com/Ellpeck/NaturesAura/issues/102). If your bug is that exception, DO NOT REPORT IT HERE. It's not a Nature's Aura issue.
