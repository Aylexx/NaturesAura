I swear to God, if one more person reports that stupid Fast Leaf Decay bug, I will lose my goddamn mind.

Check https://github.com/Ellpeck/NaturesAura/issues/82, https://github.com/Ellpeck/NaturesAura/issues/87, https://github.com/Ellpeck/NaturesAura/issues/98 or https://github.com/Ellpeck/NaturesAura/issues/102. If your bug is that exception, DO NOT REPORT IT HERE. It's not a Nature's Aura issue.
